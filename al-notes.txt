- Checked w/ the example of level 11*ZF and level 22*ZF
- The rowspaces of D1 and D2 are Tp stable (and not Up stable but they shouldn't be)
- D1 and D2 are AL(., pp) stable for pp dividing 11*ZF
- They are not so for pp dividing 2*ZF, and they shouldn't be since that operator
is meant to swap D1 and D2
- but AL(., 2*ZF) doesn't seem to swap the rowspaces of D1 and D2
- Also, the rowspaces of D1 and D2 are not disjoint - they seem to intersect 1-dimension.
I don't yet see how this can be.

Here are properties that I expect the things to obey
- Up(beta) = alpha
- Up(alpha(f)) is some linear combination of alpha(f) and beta(f), i.e.
Up preserves the old space
- AL swaps images of alpha(U) and beta(U) where U is a Galois orbit
- alpha and beta have 

Things to check
- Do AL and the degeneracy maps *actually* disagree when p^2 | N? Probably yes, but where?
Compare this to a base change example, and figure out if there's an inconsistency. If not,
then the behavior apparently distinguishes between base/non-base change, whch is weird af. 
- Where is the code presently failing? Make sure that the oldform/AL code is actually what's suspect
- Why, in the existing code, is alpha * Up = beta? It should really be the opposite...
- Confirm, via Casselman/etc., that the "usual" degeneracy maps should be the ones that work here,
and try to test what goes wrong when you use AL 
- Also confirm that AL should indeed be swapping oldspaces.
- Understand what the code is *actually* doing.
